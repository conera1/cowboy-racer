$John Deere 730 QuickStart
==========================

%While there are shop manuals, parts manuals, and operator's manuals available for the vintage 730 John Deere tractor, there are no simple QuickStart files to get the new user started with basic controls and instructions.  

Built between 1958 and 1960, the 30 series tractor was the last version of John Deere's iconic two-cylinder "Johnny Popper."  Since versions of this tractor had been in production since 1918, users were assumed to have a level of familiarity with the equipment that no longer exists.
